<p>Security is an arms race between security experts on both sides. Application at least need to have the basic security measures in place. The OWASP is an organization that advices which measures every application should take, and which updates its advices every year with the latest insights. In the security track you will do the basics to secure your application and implement additional OWASP-measures on top.</p>
<ul>
<li>The API is available via a valid https (TLS) certificate on different domains, for example production and acceptance.</li>
<li>Passwords are hashed according to the latest OWASP recommendations, or an SSO solution is used. Hashed passwords from one environment should not be able to be used on the other environment.</li>
<li>All sensitive data is encrypted. Data from one environment should not be able to be used on the other environment.</li>
<li>Access control is done following the recommendations of OWASP.</li>
<li>One additional other recommendation of the OWASP has been followed (approved by the teacher).</li>
<li>The above measures are proven by automated tests.</li>
<li>An automated process ensures that security is maintained by covering that changes are reviewed (of course this is a manual step), tested and deployed.</li>
<li>Documentation: the technical design describes all security features and measures that were taken in detail. All configuration details are described.</li>
</ul>
<p>Free TLS certificates can be obtained using Let's Encrypt.</p>
<h3>Basic requirements for grading</h3>
<ul>
<li>There is a working automatic deployment</li>
<li>There is a show-and-tell document to prove the system works.</li>
</ul></body></html>
