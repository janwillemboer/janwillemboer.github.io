<p>Advanced applications often use data from external data sources, like data sources from the government. In this track you will use external data and integrate it into your own application. This track is the most "functional" track, because the data has to have a real, logical use in your application.</p>
<ul>
<li>The external system must be complex enough, at the discretion of the teacher. A postal code check or a list of millimeters of rain for the coming hours probably won't suffice, but something that shows available parking spaces on a map probably will.</li>
<li>The system must integrate nicely with the external data / API. If you build a system that is a chat client for elderly people and also integrates an agricultural map, that doesn't make much sense.</li>
<li>Your application can handle latency or the service being offline, with fast and clear communication to the user.</li>
<li>You test this using an automated test suite.</li>
<li>There is a mock of the service for testing the functionality of your application in automated tests.</li>
<li>There needs to be a way to warn an administrator when the service goes down.</li>
<li>There needs to be a user interface to configure the service, for example to set timeouts and to set the URL in case of an external service, and to configure the warning system.</li>
<li>It is also possible to choose data that is not available as an online API. In that case you download the data to your own system and write an API yourself to expose the data. This requires you to design an additional, consistent API for that dataset next to your own application.</li>
<li>Documentation. All data, all conversions, and all features in your advanced track should be described in detail in the technical design. A manual should provide information to admins on how to use the admin part.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few hints for external sources:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://data.overheid.nl/">https://data.overheid.nl/</a>&nbsp;has all kinds of dutch government databases,</li>
<li><a href="https://opendata.rdw.nl/">https://opendata.rdw.nl/</a>&nbsp;has data from the RDW, the dutch vehicle registry,</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kadaster.nl/zakelijk/datasets/open-datasets">https://www.kadaster.nl/zakelijk/datasets/open-datasets</a>&nbsp;contains data from the Land Registry (Kadaster),</li>
<li><a href="https://www.pdok.nl/services-en-api-s">https://www.pdok.nl/services-en-api-s</a>&nbsp;has dutch mapping APIs, for example the dutch aerial photos.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/">https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/</a>&nbsp;is an API that exposes wikipedia data,</li>
<li><a href="https://data.europa.eu/">https://data.europa.eu</a>&nbsp;datasets from the EU, etc etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Common ways to expose APIs are SPARQL, REST and GraphQL. If you search for that term, you will at least know for sure that it is an API and not a download.</p>
<h3>Basic requirements for grading</h3>
<ul>
<li>An external datasource is used and integrated in the application</li>
<li>There is a show-and-tell document to prove the system works.</li>
