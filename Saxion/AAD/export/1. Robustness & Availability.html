<p>In this track you will focus on robustness of the application. For some applications like banking applications, it is important to have very high availability, to have data integrity, to know about problems as soon as possible and monitor usage and problems proactively.</p>
<p>This track combines a few subjects to realize this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Users should not be bothered if the application has to be updated. The CI/CD should include a mechanism to update the application without the application going offline. This could be accomplished by having the backend running twice, and swapping between backends while updating.</li>
<li>Admins should be able to monitor the system, and be warned about possible problems. This is done by having a monitoring system in place that monitors all possible problems and that can be configured to warn admins about events.</li>
<li>The data should be consistent. The application uses transactions to maintain consistency in the database.</li>
<li>Admins should be able to proactively look for patterns in usage and events, and be able to trace back origins of problems. This can done by logging on several levels, and having a user-friendly system in place to view and filter the logging and create reports and graphs.</li>
<li>Documentation. All measures taken, and all features in your advanced track should be described in detail in the technical design, including, of course, all configuration details. A manual should provide information to admins on how to use the logging and monitoring system.</li>
</ul>
<p>A system that can handle large amounts of logging and visualize it is the ElasticSearch database with Kibana as UI on top.</p>
<h3>Basic requirements for grading</h3>
<ul>
<li>The application uses a logging database and a monitoring system</li>
<li>There is a show-and-tell document to prove the system works.</li>
</ul></body></html>
